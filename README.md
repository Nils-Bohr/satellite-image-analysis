A Gentle Introduction to Satellite Image Processing
===================================================

Welcome to this introductory course on `Satellite Image Analysis`!

Satellite imagery has become a primary data source in the natural sciences, economics,
archaeology, sustainability, national security & defence, and many other domains which
utilize geospatial intelligence.

Indeed, the wide variety of imagery sources and the vast amounts of data being collected
are now challenging our ability to manage, process, and derive useful insight from this
information.

Motivated by this, the primary objective of the course is to provide a
systematic introduction to computer-based processing of satellite imagery, focusing on
techniques for enhancing, processing, and extracting spatial information from imagery.

This course emphasizes the practical application of computer-based image processing
(for total beginners) using programming techniques capable of analyzing large quantities
of imagery data.

The tools used focus on Python with affiliated packages such as Rasterio, GeoPandas, OpenCV,
Matplotlib etc.

Learning Outcomes
=================

    1.	Understand practical computer programming techniques for processing satellite imagery.
    2.	Develop introductory Python script-based approaches for object detection and extraction.
    3.	Become proficient in using essential computer programming tools and software (Google Colab,
        Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub etc.).
