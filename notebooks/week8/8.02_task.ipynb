    "- Download an image of your choice for where the i95 crosses the Occoquan River. \n",

    "    - Downloads the image (e.g. via week3, notebook 3.02_api_image_extraction.ipnb)\n",
    "    - Reads in the image and clips it to your geojson box (e.g. via week6, notebook 6.05_clipping_sentinel-2.ipnb).\n",
    "    - Extracts areas of water (e.g. using week8, notebook 8.01_object_extraction.ipnb).\n",
    "    - Writes the water feature shapes ready for submission.\n",

    "## Task 2\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inspect the resulting shapefile that we extracted. \n",
    "- Think critically about the output shapes. \n",
    "- Consider of a way to try reduce the quantity of shapes we are writing. Ideally, we just want the main river outline. \n",
    "- Hint: Try implement 'if statement logic' in the main loop where we iterate over `my_shapes`, convert the coordinates, and append as geojson data structures. We essentially want to exclude those small shapes with few coordinates."
