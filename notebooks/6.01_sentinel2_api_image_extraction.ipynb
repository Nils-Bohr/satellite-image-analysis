    "# API Image Extraction (via Sentinel-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will move to a more advanced topic: Automated extraction of imagery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas in the previous class we manually extracted satellite imagery from various sources (e.g. Sentinel Hub or Earth Explorer), today we will focus on how to automatically extract satellite imagery from an Application Programming Interface (API).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be surprised to find that you already engage with APIs on a daily basis when carrying out your online activity!"

    "## What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "Collecting satellite imagery via an API makes the process of image collection much easier and more efficient - thankfully!\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there can be a bit of a leap in terms of technical understanding, especially if you haven't used Python much before. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, this entire lecture is spent helping you understand how to extract imagery via an API. \n",
    "\n",
    "APIs let a product or service communicate with other products and services without needing to know specifically how each one works. Metaphorically, APIs are sometimes thought of as contracts, with documentation that represents an agreement between parties: If party 1 sends a remote request structured in a particular way, this is how party 2â€™s software will respond. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we send a request for certain satellite images to a server holding imagery data, and the requested data is collected on the server, processed, potentially compressed, and then sent (probably over a computer network such as the Internet) to our machine. We do not need to know how the server is setup or operating to make this request. And the server owner can completely change the server setup and operation, without us needing to change our code, all thanks to our handy API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, APIs in this case simplify how we connect to an existing computer infrastructure. Indeed, public APIs in general represent unique societal value because they can simplify and expand how we all connect with data (e.g. the Google Maps API is a popular example).\n",
