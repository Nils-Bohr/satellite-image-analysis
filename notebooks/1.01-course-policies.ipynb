    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Satellite imagery has become a primary data source in the natural sciences, economics, archaeology, sustainability, and many other domains which utilize geospatial intelligence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the wide variety of imagery sources and the vast amounts of data being collected are now challenging our ability to manage, process, and derive useful insight from this information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Motivated by this, the primary objective of the course is to provide a systematic introduction to computer-based processing of satellite imagery techniques for enhancing, processing, and extracting spatial information from imagery. \n",
    "\n",
    "This course emphasizes the practical application of computer-based image processing (for total beginners) using programming techniques capable of analyzing large quantities of images. "

    "## GGS Computer Lab, Assignments and Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "GGS 416 students have remote access to the GGS Virtual Computing Lab with the software required for this course. However, as the software is open source you are encouraged (where possible) to download a version on your own machine (e.g. Anaconda). \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you will require a Google account to be able to sign up to the Google Earth Engine platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "All materials will be distributed in the Jupyter Notebook format, providing all information and code in single location for you. You can also add your own notes to these notebooks. This is superior to having to deal with separate files for presentations, code, and notes in different formats. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assignments will be based on the lecture material you receive and will be administered via Blackboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, assignments will be set on a Wednesday and will be due the following week prior to the start of the lecture (except when noted in the Course Schedule). \n",
    "\n",
    "Late work will be penalized 20% for each day late. Late submissions will only go unpenalized for documented medical reasons or by previous agreement with the instructor. "

    "- 50% of the grade based on 10 assignments\n",
    "- 50% of the grade based on the submitted coursework project\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A (93%), A- (90%), B+ (87%), B (83%), B- (80%), C+ (77%), C (73%), C- (70%), D (60%)\n",
    "\n",
    "The coursework project will include the use of processing techniques taught throughout the entire semester but applied to your own research topic. Students will be expected to submit assignments online through Blackboard. Only Word document (.docx or .doc) or Adobe PDF (.pdf) file formats will be accepted. Generally, to avoid formatting changes, it is advised to save word documents as the .pdf format prior to submission."

    "(3) if you are uncertain about the ground rules on a particular assignment, ask for clarification. \n",

    "An emphasis upon diversity and inclusion throughout the campus community is essential to achieve these goals. Diversity is broadly defined to include such characteristics as, but not limited to, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, and sexual orientation. Diversity also entails different viewpoints, philosophies, and perspectives. Attention to these aspects of diversity will help promote a culture of inclusion and belonging, and an environment where diverse opinions, backgrounds, and practices can be voiced, heard, and respected.\n",
