    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Satellite imagery has become a primary data source in the natural sciences, economics, archaeology, sustainability, and many other domains which utilize geospatial intelligence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the wide variety of imagery sources and the vast amounts of data being collected are now challenging our ability to manage, process, and derive useful insight from this information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Motivated by this, the primary objective of the course is to provide a systematic introduction to computer-based processing of satellite imagery techniques for enhancing, processing, and extracting spatial information from imagery. \n",
    "\n",
    "This course emphasizes the practical application of computer-based image processing (for total beginners) using programming techniques capable of analyzing large quantities of images. "

    "\n",
    "To participate in the course, it is essential that you have a Google Account so that you can take advantage of Google Collaboratory and Google Drive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it is essential that an educational access account is obtained for Planet Labs, to obtain free satellite imagery (essential for the course). \n",
    "\n",
    "All materials will be distributed via the course GitHub page which holds all course documents and materials. Some of these resources are in the Jupyter Notebook format (.ipnb), providing all information and code in single location. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assignments will be based on the lecture material you receive and will be administered via Blackboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, assignments will be set on a Wednesday and will be due the following Tuesday evening (except when noted in the Course Schedule). Late work will be penalized 20% for each day late. Late submissions will only go unpenalized for documented medical reasons or by previous agreement with the instructor. \n"

    "## Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "Grading will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 50% of the grade based on 10 assignments\n",
    "- 50% of the grade based on the submitted coursework project\n",
    "\n",
    "Grades will be based on the following cutoff values, although the instructor reserves the right to alter the values at the end of the course: \n",
    "\n",
    "A (93%), A- (90%), B+ (87%), B (83%), B- (80%), C+ (77%), C (73%), C- (70%), D (60%)\n",
    "\n",
    "The coursework project will include the use of processing techniques taught throughout the entire semester but applied to your own research topic. Students will be expected to submit assignments online through Blackboard. Only Adobe PDF (.pdf) file formats will be accepted (students can save word documents as a .pdf format from within the program).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each student gets the opportunity to drop the two worst performing assignments from the overall score at the end of the semester. Take comfort in the fact that it is highly unlikely that three events justifying extenuating circumstances would occur in a single semester. Thus, the course grading criteria is accounting for unfortunate events. No additional requests will be accommodated unless the extenuating circumstances are highly serious (in which case the university and course director will already be aware of the issue). "

    "\n",
    "1.\tCheck if your question has already been asked on the GGS416 Blackboard discussion board.\n",
    "2.\tIf not, then place a new public question on the Blackboard discussion board.\n",
    "3.\tThen email Edward Oughton (eoughton@gmu.edu), cc’ing Ulas Qazi (uqazi2@gmu.edu), Mark Bossinger (mbossing@gmu.edu) into the same email, stating that you have placed this question. \n",
    "4.\tA response will then be publicly provided on the course discussion board, for everyone else to view. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most efficient way to interact and prevents multiple emails being sent with the same question. This is because other people may ask similar questions, so this becomes a shared knowledge base everyone can access. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember that succinct correspondence is likely to increase the efficiency of an answer.** \n",

    "\n",
    "These are as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1.\tCopy and paste any error messages into a search engine (e.g., Google). Someone else will already have had the same problem, so investigate how other researchers solved similar issues. \n",
    "2.\tExplore Stack Overflow questions and answers. When other programmers have been stuck, they post them publicly on Stack Overflow asking for answers, making this a great resource.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, if a student emails saying \"I am receiving this error\" there is very little someone can do to help. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is necessary to learn how to ask a good question. For example, make sure you read this first:\n",
    "\n",
    "%%html - <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask\">How do I ask a good question?</a>\n",
    "    \n",
    "At the very least, questions should include the original code, or a screenshot, and include the exact error message. Without this information, it is usually not possible to help solve an issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal question should have a reproducible example (a 'reprex') which demonstrates the issue. A reprex should have the smallest amount of example data and code to help produce the error. \n"

    "\n",
    "1. All work submitted be your own; \n",

    "3. If you are uncertain about the ground rules on a particular assignment, ask for clarification. \n",

Diversity is broadly defined to include such characteristics as, but not limited to, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, and sexual orientation. Diversity also entails different viewpoints, philosophies, and perspectives. Attention to these aspects of diversity will help promote a culture of inclusion and belonging, and an environment where diverse opinions, backgrounds, and practices can be voiced, heard, and respected.\n",
