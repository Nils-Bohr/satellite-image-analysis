    " - Install and update your desired data science packages\n",
    " - Create and manage virtual environments\n",
    " \n",
    "We also get ~150 scientific packages which come with the installation, so that's why the standard download is about ~.5 GB.\n",

    "- The `dir` command on Windows or `ls` command on Mac. \n",
    "    - For example, if you type `dir` then you are requesting all directories in the current folder to be printed. Thus, `dir` is short for directory. This is really helpfully to see where you can navigate to. On Mac, the `ls` command is short for `list`, as in to list the current directories in the present folder.   \n",
    "- The `cd` command (the same on Windows + Mac). \n",
